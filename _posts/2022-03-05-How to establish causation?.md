## introduction
One of the most repeated statistical facts in modern times is “Correlation does not imply causation”. This could be understood by a classic example often given in statistical courses, In the US, the production of ice creams is correlated with number of Drowning deaths as shown by the figure below:

*Fig 1: The correlation between Ice cream production and Drowning in United States*

Does this mean that an increase in Ice cream production cause more drowning? Should we stop producing ice creams to prevent drowning? Well, the answer fortunately is no. Even though these two things are correlated it does not mean they cause each other. So, to put it more simply, when the ice cream production goes up the number of people drowning also happens to increase at the same time but increase in ice cream production does not cause more drowning. It could be that there is a third variable that we have not considered that is responsible for this trend. Consider that in summer as the temperature goes up more people buy ice creams, so this increases the demand for ice creams thus ice cream production goes up. Also, during periods of high temperature more people take up swimming and therefore the likelihood of people drowning also increases. 

From this simple example we can see that it is very important we don’t wrongly derive a causal relationship from a correlation. This could lead us to come to wrong conclusions and in a business setting for example, making decisions based on wrong conclusions could mean that we incur significant losses.
