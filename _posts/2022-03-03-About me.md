Hi, welcome to my blog. I am a currently student, undertaking a Master's Degree in Data Science. Before my Master's, I did an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Finance. In this blog, I aim to share some of the interesting things that I have learnt and will continue to learn in my journey to become a better Data Scientist.
