# Introduction
In the past few years, many people entered the equity market and saw incredible returns in their portfolios however,
the market trend this year has been quite different. Currently, there is fear in the market about rising Inflation, 
Interest rate and Energy prices which is further compounded by the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict. In this article,
I want to look at the different factors affecting the current markets and how likely is it that we will have a recession. 

# Market overview
Since the beginning of this year, we saw a record rate of inflation around the globe, with an annual inflation rate of around 8% in the US for 12-month ending in March and around 6% in both the UK and EU. This is fuelled by the recent energy crisis which saw the price of energy increase by more than 30% in the US. A low rate of unemployment puts upwards pressure on wages, the US has a very high rate of unemployment at around 3.6%(close to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5%) and the UK is also not lagging far behind with 3.9%, both countries also saw strong GDP growth. These trends mean that there is increasing pressure on the Central banks to curb inflation through monetary policy, but they are also cautious not to hinder recovery from Covid, therefore it is a fine balancing act.


The most important central bank in the world is the US Federal Reserve (FED) which sets the US interest rate which essentially determines the risk-free rate for many assets in different markets. The FED has a dual mandate which means it must ensure stable prices and maximise employment in the economy. Given the current state of high inflation, high employment and high growth, the FED is looking to apply different forms of quantitative tightening measures, one of those measures was announced in the FOMC meeting minutes released on 6th April 2022 where the FED set out a plan to shrink its balance sheet by not reinvesting principal from its maturing bonds and bond coupons into new Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Security purchases. During Covid, the FED acted quickly to prevent a collapse in the market through its asset purchasing programme during which it bought Treasuries as well as Mortgage-backed securities. Currently, it has just under $9 trillion of assets which it intends to reduce at a rate of $1.1 trillion a year in the coming years. FED reducing its balance sheet by selling these assets should put upward pressure on the long end of the yield curve as it could trigger an equity market sell-off which could mean people flock towards treasuries, so it is important for the FED to adjust its strategy according to the market outlook.


Another tool the FED has to control the high level of inflation is to raise interest rates, the consensus among economists seems to be 25bp(0.25%) hike each time for the next 6 FED meetings this year. However, a rise in interest rates can become a problem in the US corporate bond market. This is because when a company borrows money from investors by issuing bonds it must pay the bondholder’s coupons in fixed intervals. When you lend money to the US government, you essentially have no risk and therefore the return you get is low, the yield of the bond is essentially the risk-free rate. However, when you lend to a corporation you know there is a risk of it not paying you the money back (risk of default) and there is a risk of you not being able to sell the bond during a period of market turmoil. Therefore, we can show the yields as:

Investors often look at credit spreads(credit risk + liquidity risk) to monitor the state of the credit market. The credit risk is the extra income that investors demand to hold the credit risk of a company. So, if the credit spread increases, then the corporate bond price falls. How much extra income the investor demands a particular bond depends on the rating of the issuer of the bond, there are many rating agencies like S&P, Moody’s and Fitch that rate companies from a scale of 'AAA'(Prime/high grade) to 'D'(a company in default). A company must have at least 'BBB' rating or above to get “investment-grade” status. There has been a widening of credit spreads across the globe as investors demand higher premiums to hold corporate bonds. Below is the credit spread over time of investment-grade bonds.

In the above figure, we can clearly see a huge spike during the Covid bond sell-off period (shaded area). We can also see that in the first quarter of the year 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a widening of credit spreads, this could be due to many factors such as inflation primarily fuelled by the energy crisis across the globe or fear of recession due to interest rate hike from central banks. 

# A Possible Downgrading Problem
One of the financial instruments that many investors prefer to trade is Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are funds that are traded on exchanges like stocks. There are many ETFs that are Investment Grade ETFs, this is to say that they pool together only Investment grade bonds and if we look at the breakdown of most of the ETFs available in the market, they mostly have BBB bonds because this is reflective of the market where most of the investment-grade debt is BBB. Investors that go for these ETFs get a higher yield because of the high BBB weightage in the fund. Below is an example of one such ETF:
