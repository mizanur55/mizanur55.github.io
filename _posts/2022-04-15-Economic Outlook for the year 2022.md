# Introduction
In the past few years, many people entered the equity market and saw incredible returns in their portfolios however,
the market trend this year has been quite different. Currently, there is fear in the market about rising Energy prices, Inflation and
Interest rate hikes, which is further compounded by the recent Russia-Ukraine conflict. In this article,
I want to look at the different factors affecting the current markets and how likely is a recession in the near future. 

# Market overview
Since the beginning of this year, we saw a record rate of inflation around the globe, with an annual inflation rate of around 8% in the US and around 6% in both the UK and EU. This is fuelled by the recent energy crisis which saw the price of energy increase by more than 30% in many countries. Furthermore, the US has recently seen a very low rate of unemployment at around 3.6%(close to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5%) and the UK is not far behind with 3.9%, such a low rate of unemployment puts upwards pressure on wages, there has been a shortage of labour supply with employers in many sectors stuggling to fill up vacancies. Many developed countries like US and UK also saw strong GDP growth. These trends mean that there is increasing pressure on the Central banks to curb inflation through monetary policy, however they are also cautious not to hinder the economic recovery from Covid.


The most important central bank in the world is the US Federal Reserve (FED) which sets the US interest rate which essentially determines the risk-free rate for many assets in different markets. The FED has a dual mandate which means it must ensure stable prices and maximise employment in the economy. Given the current state of high inflation, high employment and high growth, the FED is looking to apply different forms of quantitative tightening measures, one of those measures was announced in the FOMC meeting minutes released on 6th April 2022 where the FED set out a plan to shrink its balance sheet by not reinvesting principal from its maturing bonds and bond coupons into new Treasury and Mortgage-Backed Security purchases. During Covid, the FED acted quickly to prevent a collapse in the market through its asset purchasing programme during which it bought Treasuries as well as Mortgage-backed securities. Currently, it has just under $9 trillion of assets which it intends to reduce at a rate of $1.1 trillion a year in the coming years. FED reducing its balance sheet by selling these assets should put upward pressure on the long end of the yield curve and trigger an equity market sell-off which could mean investors flock towards treasuries, so it is important for the FED to adjust its strategy according to market events.


Another tool the FED has to control the high level of inflation is to raise interest rates, the consensus among economists seems to be 25bps(0.25%) hike each time for the next 6 FED meetings this year. However, a rise in interest rates can become a problem in the US corporate bond market. This is because when a company borrows money from investors by issuing bonds it must pay the bondholder’s coupons in fixed intervals. When you lend money to the US government, you essentially have no risk and therefore the return you get is low, the yield of the bond is essentially the risk-free rate. However, when you lend to a corporation you know there is a risk of it not paying you the money back (risk of default) and there is a risk of you not being able to sell the bond during a period of market turmoil. The figure below shows the different components that go into calculating the yield for different type of bonds:

Investors often look at credit spreads(credit risk + liquidity risk) to monitor the state of the credit market. The credit spread is the extra income that investors demand to hold the credit risk of a company. So, if the credit spread increases, then the corporate bond price falls. How much extra income the investor demands a particular bond depends on the rating of the issuer of the bond, there are many rating agencies like S&P, Moody’s and Fitch that rate companies from a scale of 'AAA'(Prime/high grade) to 'D'(a company in default). A company must have at least 'BBB' rating or above to get “investment-grade” status. Below is the credit spread over time of 'BBB' investment-grade bond:

*Fig 1: BBB Credit spread over time*[[1]](#1).

In the above figure, we can clearly see a huge spike during the Covid bond sell-off period (shaded area). We can also see that in the first quarter of the year 2022 there has been a widening of credit spreads as investors demand higher premiums to hold corporate bonds. This could be due to many factors such as inflation primarily fuelled by the energy crisis across the globe or fear of recession due to interest rate hike from central banks, also the uncertainty around the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

# A Possible credit crisis through Downgrading cycle
One of the financial instruments that many investors prefer to trade is Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). These are funds that are traded on exchanges like stocks. There are many ETFs that are Investment Grade ETFs, this is to say that they pool together only Investment grade bonds and if we look at the breakdown of most of the ETFs available in the market, they mostly have BBB bonds because this is reflective of the market where most of the investment-grade debt is BBB. Investors that go for these ETFs get a higher yield because of the high BBB weightage in the fund. Below is an example of one such ETF:

*Fig 2: Credit quality rating Breakdown of an investment Grade ETF*[[2]](#2).

Under normal credit conditions, these ETFs are a great way of investing in the bond market, however, if we get a recession then this could be a major issue for the bond market because it could trigger a widespread downgrading of multiple companies. This is because if there is a recession then this could cause the income of a company to fall which means they will find it difficult to service their debts, this could mean that they could get downgraded by the rating agencies and since most Investment grade bonds in the market are BBB, a downgrading would mean these BBB companies will now have a junk/High yield status, this will widen their credit spreads even more which means they will have to pay a higher interest rate on their debt in the future.

*Fig 3: Downgrading Cycle*

A downgrading will also mean that all the Investment grade ETFs that hold these newly downgraded BBB bonds will be forced to sell them when its time for portfolio rebalancing because they are no longer Investment grade but junk bonds. This could create contagion in the bond market, and we could see a huge bond sell-off, there is also a potential for it to spill over to equity markets in particular small caps that have high leverage.

# How likely is a recession?
In March, the FED chair Jerome Powell said, "the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated". This is a reasonable statement as we know that aggregate demand in the economy is given by:

$$ AD = C + I + G + (X - M) $$

Where $$ AD $$ is the Aggregate demand, $$ C $$ is consumption, $$ I $$ is an investment, $$ G $$ is government spending and $$ X $$ is total exports and $$ M $$ is total imports. In the US, all these factors that contribute to aggregate demand are positive. Consumption is higher because we have some pent-up demand from Covid and easing of Covid restrictions, Government spending has increased because of Covid related quantitative easing, Investments have gone up as we saw a record rally in the stock market in the recent past. Imports and exports are also strong. This means that a recession due to a Demand fall in the economy is unlikely.

If we look at the latest market news, then we currently find many news articles about the inversion of the yield curve. Many people are interpreting the yield curve inversion as a sign of a recession. Normally people take a long maturity US government bond like the US 10-year treasury note and compare it with a short maturity bond like the U.S. 2-year treasury bill. If the difference is negative then this is a signal of recession, although this model is fairly accurate it has some false positives, a better model is the ‘Sahm rule’, devised by the economist Claudia Sahm, This model takes the 3-month moving average rate of unemployment and we compare it with the minimum unemployment rate over the past 12 months, if the three months moving average rate of unemployment rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months then that indicates a start of a recession in the US. It is incredibly accurate for US with no false positives since 1950s.

*Fig 4: Sahm rule over time*[[3]](#3).

From the plot above we can see that currently, the ‘Sahm rule’ does not indicate a beginning of a recession. The federal reserve bank of New York also has a model which takes the 10-year treasury yield and 3-month treasury yield and uses a normal distribution model to predict the probability of a recession 12 months ahead. Using the current treasury yields for 10-year and 3-months, the probability of a recession in the US is about 4%. Therefore, according to this model, it is very unlikely that we will have a recession in the next 12 months.

# Conclusion
In this article, we looked at the current market condition as well as what the federal reserve is doing to guide the market on a path that it desires. We also looked at some interesting developments in the credit market which could spread volatility and create contagion in other markets across the world. Finally, we went through some models that are used to predict recessions and we saw that we get different answers about the likelihood of recession with different models, So we have to be careful and should not take just one model like the yield curve inversion to work out the probability of a recession, the markets are currently volatile and unpredictable and we will have to wait and see how things such as the Russian-Ukraine conflict, FED Quantitative tightening, inflation and the economic recovery from Covid plays out to really judge the future economic outlook.
