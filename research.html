          <p>Abstract: Vehicle manufacturers and governments across the U.S. employ various subsidies to
            promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). These subsidies develop networks of
            EV charging stations and subsidize the price consumers pay for charging. However,
            doing so sensibly is hampered by a poor understanding of EV drivers' demand for
            stations and charging. Using charging-session level data from the Evergy charging
            network in Kansas City, at a time when there was a discrete end to a charging price
            subsidy, I empirically analyze drivers' charging behavior. I find driver charging
            decreased 55% when the price subsidy ended, and station characteristics, such as
            the type of business near a station, play an important role in driver demand for
            stations. Counterfactual analysis indicates the charging price subsidy provided
            \$0.81 in value to drivers for every dollar spent on the subsidy and stations vary
            significantly in the value they provide to drivers. These findings suggest the need
            to account for the effects of station characteristics and charging price in future EV
            subsidy programs.

            <li><a href="static/paper2_text2.pdf">"Does Electric Vehicle Station Density Affect Usage?"</a>
            <p>Abstract: The growth in electric vehicle (EV) adoption over the last decade has increased
            the need for EV charging stations. However, existing research on optimal charging
            station placement assumes EV drivers substitute between stations like drivers of
            gasoline vehicles even thought it take 4-12 hours to fully charge an EV. This paper
            uses transaction-level charging data from the Evergy charging network in Kansas
            City to analyze how drivers substitute across charging stations. I find, unlike gasoline 
            stations, the density of stations in an area has no affect on station usage when
            there is an increase in charging price. Similarly, previous charging behavior has a
            much larger effect on driver substitution patterns than the distance between stations
            or the charging price. These results indicate differences in substitution patterns for
            gasoline and EV stations which should inform future station placement.</p></li>

          <li><strong>"How Do Electric Vehicle Station Subsidies Affect New Station Construction?"</strong>
            <p>Summary: Over the last decade there have been an increasing number of subsidy programs that
            encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. One common approach is through subsidizing 
            the construction of electric vehicle charging stations, but it is unclear how 
            much these subsidies induce new station construction. This paper finds 
            that these subsidies increase the number of stations built in areas already experiencing EV adoption but 
            do not have an effect on cities with low EV adoption.</p></li>
          
           <li><strong>"How Does Private Development of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Affect Vehicle Demand?"</strong>
            <p>Summary: Before 2019, Nissan incentivized the sale of their electric vehicles through the development of their own charging 
            network and offered free charging to drivers who bought their vehicles. 
            This project explores how Nissan's charging network affects demand for their vehicles
            in local areas by using zip code vehicle registrations data and the location and open date of stations 
            on Nissan's charging network. This project will allow us to better understand the affects of private investment in 
            charging and observe how charging near a driver's home affects EV adoption. </p></li>
