          <li><strong>"How Do Electric Vehicle Station Subsidies Affect New Station Construction?"</strong>
            <p>Summary: Over the last decade there have been an increasing number of subsidy programs that
            encourage the adoption of electric vehicles. One common approach is through subsidizing 
            the construction of electric vehicle charging stations, but it is unclear how 
            much these subsidies induce new station construction. This paper finds 
            that these subsidies increase the number of stations built in areas already experiencing EV adoption but 
            do not have an effect on cities with low EV adoption.</p></li>
          
           <li><strong>"How Does Private Development of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Affect Vehicle Demand?"</strong>
            <p>Summary: Before 2019, Nissan incentivized the sale of their electric vehicles through the development of their own charging 
            network and offered free charging to drivers who bought their vehicles. 
            This project explores how Nissan's charging network affects demand for their vehicles
            in local areas by using zip code vehicle registrations data and the location and open date of stations 
            on Nissan's charging network. This project will allow us to better understand the affects of private investment in 
            charging and observe how charging near a driver's home affects EV adoption. </p></li>
